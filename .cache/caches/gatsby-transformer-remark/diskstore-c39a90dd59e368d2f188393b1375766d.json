I used to watch youtube videos where they implement it with <code class=\"language-text\">PHP</code>. But they all just don't workout for me. Thank god there's <code class=\"language-text\">File API</code> which  allows javascript to access information about file like <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Last modified</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Type</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Size</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">webkitRelativePath</code>.
